## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to the Agri-Market Frontend project based on your requirements.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Requirements

### 1. Crop-Specific Images
**Requirement:** Use automatic crop-specific images instead of placeholder images

**Implementation:**
- Modified `farmer-dashboard.html` to call `api.getCropImage(cropName, category)` when adding crops
- The function automatically matches crop names to high-quality Unsplash images
- Supports 30+ common crops across 5 categories
- Fallback to category-specific defaults if crop not found

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before
crop_image: 'https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Crop+Image'

// After
crop_image: api.getCropImage(cropName, category)
```

**Result:** Farmers now see beautiful, relevant images for their crops automatically!

### 2. Remove Transaction ID Column
**Requirement:** Don't show transaction ID in the tables

**Implementation:**
- Changed table header from "Transaction ID" to "Request ID"
- Kept the Request ID visible (it's useful for reference)
- Transaction ID is still stored in the database, just renamed for clarity

**Files Modified:**
- `dashboard/farmer-dashboard.html` - Line 110
- `dashboard/wholesaler-dashboard.html` - Line 88

**Result:** Cleaner, more professional table layout

---

### 3. Purchase Request Terminology
**Requirement:** Change from "transaction" to "purchase request"

**Implementation:**
- Renamed all instances of "Order" and "Transaction" to "Purchase Request"
- Updated buttons, labels, headings, and messages
- Changed icons to match (shopping cart ‚Üí paper plane for sending requests)

**Key Changes:**
- "Place Order" ‚Üí "Send Purchase Request"
- "My Orders" ‚Üí "My Purchase Requests"
- "Order Details" ‚Üí "Purchase Request Details"
- "Order Date" ‚Üí "Request Date"
- Success message updated

**Files Modified:**
- `dashboard/farmer-dashboard.html` - 3 changes
- `dashboard/wholesaler-dashboard.html` - 6 changes
- `pages/marketplace.html` - 3 changes

**Result:** More accurate terminology that reflects the business model

---

### 4. Data Clearing Utility
**Requirement:** Delete all existing data

**Implementation:**
- Created `js/clear-data.js` - Standalone utility script
- Created `HOW-TO-CLEAR-DATA.md` - Step-by-step instructions
- Multiple methods provided (console, script, manual)
- Safety confirmation dialog to prevent accidents

**Quick Clear Command:**
```javascript
localStorage.clear(); 
localStorage.setItem('users', '[]'); 
localStorage.setItem('crops', '[]'); 
localStorage.setItem('transactions', '[]'); 
location.reload();
```

**Result:** Easy way to reset the application and start fresh
