# 🔐 Auto-Login & Session Management - Agri-Market

## ✅ Smart Login System

Your Agri-Market now has an **intelligent session management system** that keeps users logged in!

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **After Registration** → Auto-Login ✅
```
User registers → Automatically logged in → Redirected to dashboard
NO need to login again!
```

**Flow:**
1. User fills registration form
2. System creates account
3. **Automatically logs in the user**
4. Redirects to their dashboard (Farmer/Wholesaler)

### 2. **Already Logged In** → Direct to Dashboard ✅
```
User visits homepage → Already logged in → Redirected to dashboard
NO login screen shown!
```

**Flow:**
1. User opens `index.html`
2. System checks if already logged in
3. **Automatically redirects to dashboard**
4. No need to login again

### 3. **After Logout** → Login Required ✅
```
User logs out → Session cleared → Must login to access dashboard
```

**Flow:**
1. User clicks "Logout"
2. Session cleared from localStorage
3. Redirected to homepage
4. Must login to access dashboard again
