   - Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt, argon2)

2. **Data Storage**:
   - LocalStorage is not encrypted
   - Sensitive data should be stored server-side

3. **Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT tokens
   - Add session timeout
   - Use HTTPS in production

4. **Input Validation**:
   - Add server-side validation
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Sanitize all user inputs

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome (recommended)
